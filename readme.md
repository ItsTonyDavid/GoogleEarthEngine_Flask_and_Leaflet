# This is a Tutorial in how to combine Google Earth Engine with Leaflet in a Flask app.

You can follow the full tutorial at [Medium.com/@itsTonyDavid](https://medium.com/@itsTonyDavid) more specific right [here](https://medium.com/@itsTonyDavid)

For this tutorial, I am expecting that you already have knowledge with flask, and the basics of Google Earth Engine. As well as Front-end knowledge, which means HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
